		  squares to statistical estimation problems is considerably
		  wider than is generally appreciated. It extends beyond the
		  exponential-family-type generalized linear models to other
		  distributions, to non-linear parameterizations, and to
		  dependent observations. Various criteria for estimation
		  other than maximum likelihood, including resistant
		  alternatives, may be used. The algorithms are generally
		  numerically stable, easily programmed without the aid of
		  packages, and highly suited to interactive computation.},
